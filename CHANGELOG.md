# CHANGELOG

## v10.2.0 (2026-02-27)

### Traversal engine hardening
- **Traversal termination updated:** stops on hop ceiling, fired-node budget, and context-character budget.
- **Defaults changed:** `beam_width: 3 → 8`, `max_hops: 15 → 30`, `fire_threshold: 0.0 → 0.01`.
- **New control:** `max_fired_nodes` hard-cap added for traversal loops.
- **Context budget enforcement:** `max_context_chars` is enforced during traversal, not only at render time.
- **Default CLI / script behavior:** `query_brain.py` now defaults to `max_context_chars=20000` for logged session flow.
- Test count updated to **203** (from 200).

## v10.1.0 (2026-02-27)

### Real-time correction flow
- **Fired-node logging:** `query_brain.py --chat-id` persists fired nodes to `fired_log.jsonl` per conversation, with 7-day rolling prune. Corrections can now find what to penalize even hours after the original query.
- **Same-turn corrections:** new `learn_correction.py` reads fired log by chat_id, penalizes via `apply_outcome`, and optionally injects a CORRECTION node — all in one command.
- **Dedup with batch harvester:** `injected_corrections.jsonl` prevents double-injection when the 2-hour harvester later processes the same correction. `init_agent_brain.py` reads the dedup log on rebuild.

### CLI DX improvements
- **Query text output shows node IDs** — no more `--json` required for the learn workflow. Format: `node_id / ~~~ / content`.
- **`learn --json` returns summary** (`{"edges_updated": N, "max_weight_delta": X}`) instead of dumping the entire graph.
- **`health` text output is human-readable** — `Brain health: / Nodes / Edges / Reflex% Habitual% Dormant% / Orphans / Cross-file edges`.
- **`inject` auto-detects hash-v1 embedder** and defaults `--connect-min-sim` to 0.0 (was 0.3, causing zero connections for users without OpenAI).

### OpenAI integration
- `crabpath/openai_embeddings.py` — `OpenAIEmbedder` class wrapping `text-embedding-3-small`.
- `crabpath/openai_llm.py` — `openai_llm_fn` and `chat_completion` for GPT-5-mini routing/scoring.
- CLI flags: `--embedder openai` for init/query/inject, `--llm openai` for init/merge/connect.
- Zero new required dependencies — `openai` is an optional runtime import.

### Documentation overhaul
- **README rewritten:** value prop first, 5-minute quickstart with A→B learning story, "Correcting mistakes" and "Adding new knowledge" sections promoted to top.
- **TEACHING documented:** all three injection types (CORRECTION, TEACHING, DIRECTIVE) explained with examples. Previously only CORRECTION was documented — three production agents independently thought rebuild was required to add new knowledge.
- **Competition table:** CrabPath vs Plain RAG vs Reflexion vs MemGPT.
- **New sections:** State lifecycle, Cost control, "How CrabPath differs from related tools".
- **Session replay demoted** to "Optional: warm start" with skip note for new users.

### New examples
- `examples/cold_start/` — guided zero-session walkthrough with canned queries and expected output.
- `examples/correction_flow/` — generic fired-node logging pattern for any agent framework (hash embedder, no API key).
- `examples/sample_workspace/` expanded from 3 to 5 files (added `incidents.md`, `onboarding.md`) for cross-file routing demos.
- `examples/openclaw_adapter/agents_hook.md` updated with full inject + correction + chat-id logging template.

### Tests
- 200 tests (was 188), 8 simulations all passing.
- New tests: hash-embedder inject default, query text node IDs, health readable output, learn summary, correction flow integration (3 tests).

## v10.0.0
### What Changed
- Added CLI and API flows so CrabPath can inject and persist correction/teaching signals without rebuilding the entire state.
- Expanded operational guidance and verification workflow so feedback and correction behavior can be validated deterministically.

- Added live injection APIs (`inject_node`, `inject_correction`, `inject_batch`) with CLI support via `crabpath inject`, enabling runtime updates during operation.
- Added direct graph node injection paths for TEACHING, DIRECTIVE, and CORRECTION workflows, plus lightweight injection stats payloads from the CLI.

- Expanded reproducibility docs with live injection verification steps so users can confirm graph updates and health signals after corrective actions.

## v9.3.1
- Hardened command entrypoints and replay/logging behavior for edge cases in graph indexing and state workflows.
- Improved docs around runtime injection, exports, and deterministic test paths to make troubleshooting and operator handoff faster.

## v9.3.0
- Introduced live injection primitives (`inject_*`) and correction-node inhibitory edge behavior.
- Added the `crabpath inject` command path and supporting test coverage for repeatable feedback workflows.

## v9.1.0
- Added adversarial tests and latency benchmark harness updates to surface stability issues before release.
- Added interaction extraction and benchmark cleanup paths so simulation artifacts are predictable across runs.

## v9.0.0
- Delivered 20 user-feedback fixes focused on inhibitory suppression, file-type handling, `max_chars`, and `doctor/info` behavior.
- Tuned graph traversal defaults and diagnostics so noisy retrieval cases now recover more gracefully in production-like inputs.

## v8.0.0
- Unified state format and added dimension validation to prevent accidental embedding mismatches.
- Documented core design tenets to make production constraints explicit for integrators.

## v7.0.0
- Brought `HashEmbedder` into the core implementation as a built-in default path.
- This removed external required dependencies from baseline operation while preserving callback flexibility.

## v6.0-6.1
- Removed subprocess-based paths and deduplicated helper logic to simplify execution flow.
- This reduced operational complexity and improved reliability for smaller deployments.

## v5.0-5.3
- Removed provider-specific integrations and standardized pure callback behavior.
- This made core graph operations less opinionated and easier to adapt across embedding/LLM stacks.

## v4.0-4.5
- Added LLM-based features and batch callback execution paths.
- Improved how route extraction and scoring can combine deterministic traversal with optional model guidance.

## v3.0.0
- Rewrote the graph engine core with zero dependencies.
- Added a stable, dependency-light baseline for local, offline usage and reproducible graph state files.
