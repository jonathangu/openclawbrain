# The Core Thesis: Shadow Routing + Ultimate Policy Gradient (OpenClawBrain)

Date: 2026-03-02

## TL;DR
OpenClawBrain should feel *fast* at runtime and *smarter* every day.

We get both by splitting the system into two loops:

1) **Runtime (fast, deterministic, no LLM calls):**
   - Embed the query.
   - Retrieve seed nodes.
   - Traverse a learned memory graph.
   - Emit a compact `prompt_context`.

2) **Learning (async, parallel, high leverage):**
   - Replay recent traversal decision points.
   - Ask a teacher model what it *would have routed to*.
   - Convert dense labels into policy-gradient updates over edges.

This yields **fewer turns, fewer tokens, better context**, while preserving stable runtime latency.

---

## Why this matters
The failure mode of most "memory" systems is *interactive pointer chasing*:

- Retrieve something vague → see a pointer → retrieve again → follow another pointer → repeat

That creates:

- More tool calls
- More context bloat
- More turns
- Worse tail latency

OpenClawBrain’s goal is the opposite: **one fast context load** that gets you into the right neighborhood, plus a background learning loop that makes the next context load even better.

## Definitions

### `runtime_route_fn` (money-maker)
A **lightning-fast local routing policy** used during traversal to choose which candidate edges to expand.

**Inputs** (conceptually):
- `query_embedding` (already computed)
- `source_node` (current node)
- `candidate_edges` (habitual edges) with:
  - learned `edge.weight`
  - optional dense weak-supervision `edge.metadata["relevance"]`
  - target node vector (cached in index)

**Output:**
- deterministic list of next target node IDs (top-K)

**Key requirement:** no network calls; CPU-only math; deterministic.

### `async_route_fn` (teacher labeler)
An **offline** labeling function that answers:

> Given the query + the current node + candidate edges, what should we expand next?

It can be an LLM and is allowed to be slow, because it runs in the background and is heavily parallelized.
For the current proof/operator-default stack, hold it to a local Ollama teacher such as `qwen3.5:9b-q4_K_M` unless you explicitly switch providers.

**Output (robust JSON):**
- `choose`: a short list of target IDs, and/or
- `scores`: per-target scores in [-1, 1]

---

## The ultimate policy gradient
We treat traversal as a policy over actions (edges):

- **State**: (query, current node, candidate edges)
- **Action**: choose the next edge(s) to expand
- **Policy parameters**: edge weights (+ optional relevance metadata)

The **ultimate policy gradient** idea:

- Human feedback provides *high-authority reward*.
- Self-learning (agent outcomes) provides strong reward.
- Harvester signals provide medium reward.
- Async teacher labels provide *massive volume* of weak supervision.

All of these are different *reward sources* that can be unified into the same policy-gradient update rule.

In practice this looks like:

- Use the teacher to generate dense edge-level labels.
- Apply bounded REINFORCE updates (`apply_outcome_pg`) to edge weights.
- Optionally store teacher signal as `edge.metadata["relevance"]` to influence logits.

The key is **asymmetry**:
- Teacher is lower weight per sample.
- Teacher is higher volume.
- Humans are highest weight.

---

## Runtime routing (deterministic, context-conditioned)
The simplest fast policy that already conditions on context is:

```
score(edge) = edge.weight
          + (edge.relevance if enabled)
          + α * cosine(query_vec, target_vec)
```

Then choose `top_k` edges by score (deterministic tie-break by target_id).

This is "transformer → number" without paying transformer cost twice:
- the transformer already produced the query embedding
- routing is just dot products and adds

---

## Structural plasticity remains core
The background policy-gradient loop does **not** replace structural graph evolution.

We still want (and keep):
- **split**: break oversized nodes
- **merge**: consolidate duplicates
- **connect**: propose new edges
- **prune**: remove dead wood
- **inject**: create new nodes from explicit corrections/teachings/directives

The new async teacher + PG loop makes these mechanisms smarter by producing:
- cleaner trajectories
- denser, less noisy edge-strength signals
- better edge relevance metadata

---

## Implementation milestones

### Milestone 0 (shipped)
- `async-route-pg`: teacher shadow loop + PG updates (dry-run by default; `--apply` gated)

### Milestone 1 (shipped)
- `route_mode=edge+sim`: runtime query-conditioned routing based on embeddings + learned weights + relevance

### Milestone 2 (shipped)
- Explicit reward-source weighting (`openclawbrain.reward.RewardWeights`) across human/self/harvester/teacher.
- Replayable route traces in `openclawbrain.trace` + unified labels in `openclawbrain.labels`.
- Learned runtime route policy in `openclawbrain.route_model` + `route_mode=learned`.
- Storage boundary interfaces in `openclawbrain.storage` for state/event persistence.

### Next milestones
- Add an eval harness that measures: token count, turn count, and retrieval correctness.
- Add shortcut/pointer edge creation offline (teacher-assisted connect during maintain).

## How to run (operator sketch)
1) Run `async-route-pg` in dry-run and inspect JSON deltas.
2) Apply to a copied state first.
3) Train `route_model.npz` from traces/labels and enable runtime `route_mode=learned`.

---

## The promise
If we do this right, OpenClawBrain becomes a system where:

- Runtime stays fast and predictable.
- Every conversation generates training data.
- The brain improves continuously.
- Humans steer direction; teachers provide volume.

That is the core thesis.
