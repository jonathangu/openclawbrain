# Shadow Routing + Ultimate Policy Gradient (PR 2)

This PR introduces explicit protocol and policy boundaries without changing CLI/API behavior.

## Two timescales

- Runtime fast path: synchronous daemon query handling (`query`) with deterministic retrieval and routing decisions.
- Async teacher updates: background/ops flows (`async_route_pg` and related maintenance/learning tasks) that improve edge policy over time.

The runtime path must remain low-latency and deterministic. Teacher updates can be slower and can aggregate broader evidence.

## Route function contracts

- `runtime_route_fn`: deterministic function used during traversal to rank habitual edge candidates for a single query.
  - Inputs: source id, candidate edges, query text.
  - Behavior: deterministic sort by score, then target id tie-break.
  - Ownership: `openclawbrain.policy.make_runtime_route_fn`.

- `async_route_fn`: teacher-side policy update behavior (outside this PR), used to adjust route behavior based on delayed outcomes.
  - Inputs/outputs may evolve with teacher signals and reward decomposition.
  - Must not break runtime determinism contract.

## Why protocol + policy modules

- `openclawbrain.protocol`:
  - Adds versioned request/response helpers and typed query parameter parsing (`QueryRequest`, `QueryParams`, `QueryResponse`).
  - Centralizes validation and conversion from raw dicts.
  - Keeps error semantics deterministic and consistent.

- `openclawbrain.policy`:
  - Isolates routing policy shape (`RoutingPolicy`) from daemon request handling.
  - Encapsulates deterministic runtime routing function construction.
  - Makes policy behavior testable without daemon process setup.

This split keeps daemon focused on orchestration, while protocol and policy remain independently testable modules.

## Reward source weighting

Async updates now support explicit reward channels:

- `human` (default weight `1.0`)
- `self` (default weight `0.6`)
- `harvester` (default weight `0.3`)
- `teacher` (default weight `0.1`)

`async-route-pg` applies policy-gradient outcomes as:

`scaled_outcome = scale_reward(score_scale * teacher_score, reward_source, reward_weights)`

Current behavior remains backward compatible because the default source is `teacher`, and teacher scores still drive updates exactly as before except for the source multiplier.

## Trace schema (state/action/candidate set)

PR2 introduces first-class replayable routing traces in `openclawbrain.trace`:

- `RouteCandidate`
  - `target_id`, `edge_weight`, `edge_relevance`, optional `similarity`
  - `target_preview`, `target_file`, `target_authority`
  - Optional score telemetry: `graph_prior_score`, `router_score_raw`, `final_score`
- `RouteDecisionPoint`
  - `query_text`, `source_id`, `source_preview`
  - `candidates[]`
  - `teacher_choose[]`, `teacher_scores{}`
  - Optional confidence telemetry: `router_entropy`, `router_conf`, `router_margin`, `relevance_entropy`, `relevance_conf`, `policy_disagreement`
  - `ts`, `reward_source`
- `RouteTrace`
  - `query_id`, `ts`, optional `chat_id`
  - `query_text`, `seeds`, `fired_nodes`
  - `traversal_config`, `route_policy`
  - `decision_points[]`

Determinism contract:

- JSON serialization uses sorted keys.
- Candidate ordering is deterministic: edge weight descending, then `target_id` ascending.
- Trace JSONL can be replayed exactly for reproducible teacher-labeling runs.

## Replay and teacher labeling flow

`async-route-pg` supports two execution paths:

1. Build traces from recent journal query events.
2. Or load prebuilt traces via `--traces-in`.
3. Optionally persist traces before labeling via `--traces-out`.
4. Label decision points via teacher (`openai` or custom labeler).
5. Apply PG updates using weighted reward scaling.

This split decouples trajectory sampling from supervision so label policies can be rerun deterministically against fixed decision-point sets.

## Phase 2a: RL-native structural maintenance

Phase 2a adds two RL-native controls on top of the existing async teacher loop:

- Confidence-modulated reinforcement:
  - `async-route-pg` now modulates update magnitude by decision `router_conf` when available.
  - Effective update scale is `score_scale * teacher_score * (0.5 + 0.5*router_conf)` before reward-source weighting.
  - Backward compatibility: if confidence is missing, multiplier defaults to `1.0`.

- Soft prune maintenance (`soft_prune` task):
  - Marks edges as inactive (`edge.metadata["inactive"]=true`) rather than deleting them.
  - Triggered by strong negative local evidence:
    - highly negative `relevance` with high `relevance_conf` (when confidence exists), or
    - consistently negative teacher evidence from traces/labels or stored teacher-score aggregates.
  - Authority-protected nodes are never soft-pruned (`constitutional`, `canonical`).
  - Hard prune (`prune`) remains separate and still removes low-weight edges/nodes.

## Mega rearchitecture addendum

New modules and boundaries:
- `openclawbrain.storage`: state/event persistence interfaces (`StateStore`, `EventStore`) with JSON implementations.
- `openclawbrain.route_model`: low-rank learned policy scorer with NPZ save/load.
- `openclawbrain.labels`: unified `LabelRecord` for teacher/human/self supervision.

Runtime learned mode:
- `route_mode=learned` uses `policy.make_learned_route_fn`.
- `QTsim` is the Query-Target Similarity term: route-model projected query/target similarity plus bias only.
- Graph prior is explicit and separate: `graph_prior_i = rel_conf*r_i + (1-rel_conf)*w_i`.
  - `w_i = edge.weight`
  - `r_i = edge.metadata.relevance` (default `0`)
  - `rel_conf = 1 - H_norm(softmax(r))`, with margin fallback for very small candidate sets.
- Router confidence is similarly computed from `QTsim` logits:
  - `router_conf = 1 - H_norm(softmax(QTsim))`, with margin fallback for very small candidate sets.
- Final runtime score mixes both policies by confidence:
  - `final_i = router_conf*QTsim_i + (1-router_conf)*graph_prior_i`
- Runtime ranking remains deterministic top-k with target-id tie-breaks.

Trace/schema updates:
- `RouteTrace` now supports optional `query_vector`.
- `async-route-pg --include-query-vector` can emit query vectors into trace JSONL.

Training CLI:
- `openclawbrain train-route-model --state ... --traces-in ... --out ...`
- Numpy-only SGD over cross-entropy against teacher/human/self label distributions.
- `train-route-model` trains the `QTsim` router from traces + labels (distillation and RL-derived labels), with constant edge features so weight/relevance are not direct router inputs.
