"""
CrabPath Activation — Neuron-style firing over a memory graph.

The model (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire):
  1. Traces decay (time has passed since last activation)
  2. Seed nodes receive energy (potential increases)
  3. Each step: nodes whose potential >= threshold FIRE
  4. Firing sends energy along outgoing edges: weight × signal
     - Positive weight → excitatory (adds energy to target)
     - Negative weight → inhibitory (removes energy from target)
  5. Fired nodes: potential resets to 0 (refractory), trace refreshes
  6. Non-fired potentials decay each step (leak)
  7. Return fired nodes ranked by energy, with timing info

Learning is STDP-aware: edges in the causal direction (source fired
before target) get more credit than anti-causal edges.

Zero dependencies. Pure Python.
