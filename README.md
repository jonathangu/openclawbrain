## OpenClaw Integration (start here if you run OpenClaw)

OpenClawBrain is designed to be the memory layer for **OpenClaw agents**.

- Canonical operator runbook: **[docs/operator-guide.md](docs/operator-guide.md)**
- Canonical one-page quickstart: **[docs/operator-quickstart.md](docs/operator-quickstart.md)**
- Guide: **[docs/openclaw-integration.md](docs/openclaw-integration.md)**

Quickstart (OpenClaw users):

```bash
pip install openclawbrain
openclawbrain init --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace --output ~/.openclawbrain/main
openclawbrain serve start --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json
```

Production Deployment (socket):

Use LaunchAgent/systemd to keep the socket server running:

```bash
openclawbrain serve start --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json
```

macOS (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openclawbrain.daemon.plist`):

```xml
<key>ProgramArguments</key>
<array>
  <string>/usr/bin/env</string>
  <string>openclawbrain</string>
  <string>serve</string>
  <string>start</string>
  <string>--state</string>
  <string>/Users/YOU/.openclawbrain/main/state.json</string>
</array>
```

Linux (`/etc/systemd/system/openclawbrain-daemon.service`):

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/env openclawbrain serve start --state /home/YOUR_USER/.openclawbrain/main/state.json
```

```bash
python3 -m openclawbrain.socket_client --socket ~/.openclawbrain/main/daemon.sock --method health --params "{}"
```

OpenClaw adapter query example with runtime routing (`route_mode=edge+sim`):

```bash
python3 -m openclawbrain.openclaw_adapter.query_brain \
  ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json \
  "summarize prior deploy failures" \
  --chat-id "chat-123" \
  --format prompt \
  --route-mode edge+sim \
  --route-top-k 5 \
  --route-alpha-sim 0.5 \
  --route-use-relevance
```

**OpenClawBrain learns from your agent feedback, so wrong answers get suppressed instead of resurfacing.** It builds a memory graph over your workspace, remembers what worked, and routes future answers through learned paths.

- Pure Python 3.10+ core (no vector DB). OOTB embeddings are local (`fastembed`, BGE-small), so OpenAI is not required.
- Built-in local + hash embeddings for offline/default operation; OpenAI embeddings are optional.
- Builds a **`state.json`** brain from your workspace.
- Queries follow learned routes instead of only similarity matches.
- Positive feedback (`+1`) uses the default policy-gradient learner `apply_outcome_pg()` (conserving probability mass across traversed nodes), while negative (`-1`) creates inhibitory edges.
- Over time, less noise appears and recurring mistakes are less likely.

- OpenClawBrain integrates with your agent's file-based workspace through incremental sync, constitutional anchors, and optional/scheduled compaction.
- See the [context lifecycle](docs/architecture.md) for details.

## Install

```bash
pip install openclawbrain
```

See also: [Setup Guide](docs/setup-guide.md) for a complete local configuration walkthrough.

## Why OpenClawBrain

- Static retrieval vs learned routing: OpenClawBrain continuously updates node-to-node edges so good routes strengthen and bad routes decay.
- No correction propagation vs inhibitory edges: incorrect context can be actively suppressed and forgotten less often than in similarity-only systems.
- Bulk context load vs targeted traversal: context windows stay focused by following likely retrieval routes.
- No structural maintenance vs prune/merge/compact: OpenClawBrain includes scheduled maintenance commands to keep the graph healthy and compact.
- No protection vs constitutional anchors: anchor critical nodes with authority so operational instructions do not drift.

## 5-minute operator path (OOTB)

```bash
# 1) init (default embedder auto -> local fastembed -> hash fallback)
openclawbrain init --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace --output ~/.openclawbrain/main

# 2) start service
openclawbrain serve start --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json

# 3) status check
openclawbrain serve status --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json

# 4) query example (daemon socket)
python3 -m openclawbrain.socket_client \
  --socket ~/.openclawbrain/main/daemon.sock \
  --method query \
  --params '{"query":"summarize deploy rollback policy","top_k":4}'

# 5) stop service
openclawbrain serve stop --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json
```

## Correcting mistakes (the main workflow)

When your agent retrieves wrong context, teach OpenClawBrain in one command:

```bash
openclawbrain inject --state brain/state.json \
  --id "correction::42" \
  --content "Never show API keys in chat messages" \
  --type CORRECTION
```

What happens:
1. OpenClawBrain creates a new node with your correction text
2. It connects that node to the most related workspace chunks
3. It adds **inhibitory edges** — negative-weight links that suppress those chunks
4. Next query touching that topic: the correction appears, the bad route is dampened

To add knowledge without suppressing anything, use `--type TEACHING` instead.

### Structural corrections with split

Alongside inhibitory edges and periodic merge, maintenance now supports runtime splitting:

- `openclawbrain maintain` runs `scale` after `decay`, then `split` before `merge`.
- `suggest_splits()` finds bloated multi-topic nodes (including merged-byline nodes).
- `split_node()` rewires outgoing and incoming edges into focused child nodes, then removes the parent.
- Inhibitory edges are always copied to every child, so suppressions are not lost.
- `openclawbrain maintain` now also includes optional homeostatic controls: decay half-life auto-adjusts to keep reflex-edge ratio in range, and synaptic scaling uses a soft per-node weight budget (5.0) with fourth-root scaling.
- `Tier hysteresis: habitual band 0.15-0.6` prevents threshold thrashing.

## Self-learning (autonomous agent learning)

Agents can learn from their own observations — both mistakes and successes — without human feedback (self-correct available as CLI/API alias).

```bash
# Agent detected a failure — penalize the bad path and inject a correction
openclawbrain self-learn --state brain/state.json \
  --content 'Always download model artifacts before terminating training instances' \
  --fired-ids 'infra.md::3,cleanup.md::1' \
  --outcome -1.0 --type CORRECTION

# Agent succeeded — reinforce the good path and record what worked
openclawbrain self-learn --state brain/state.json \
  --content 'Download-then-terminate sequence works reliably for model training' \
  --fired-ids 'infra.md::3,download.md::1' \
  --outcome 1.0 --type TEACHING

# Agent learned something new (neutral — just adding knowledge)
openclawbrain self-learn --state brain/state.json \
  --content 'GBM training takes ~40 min on g5.xlarge' \
  --outcome 0 --type TEACHING
```

The full spectrum:

| Situation | outcome | type | Effect |
|-----------|---------|------|--------|
| Agent made a mistake | -1.0 | CORRECTION | Penalize fired path + inject with inhibitory edges |
| Agent learned a fact | 0.0 | TEACHING | Inject knowledge only, no weight changes |
| Agent succeeded | +1.0 | TEACHING | Reinforce fired path + inject positive knowledge |

Via socket (Python):

```python
from openclawbrain.socket_client import OCBClient

with OCBClient('~/.openclawbrain/main/daemon.sock') as client:
    # Agent detected its own mistake
    client.self_learn(
        content='Always download artifacts before terminating instances',
        fired_ids=['infra.md::3', 'cleanup.md::1'],
        outcome=-1.0,
        node_type='CORRECTION',
    )

    # Agent observed a success — reinforce
    client.self_learn(
        content='Chunked download with checksum verification works reliably',
        fired_ids=['download.md::0', 'validate.md::1'],
        outcome=1.0,
        node_type='TEACHING',
    )
```

This enables autonomous learning loops: agents observe outcomes, detect failures and successes, and teach themselves — no human in the loop. `self-correct` is available as CLI/API alias.

## Adding new knowledge (no rebuild needed)

When you learn something that isn't in any workspace file, inject it directly:

```bash
openclawbrain inject --state brain/state.json \
  --id "teaching::codex-spark" \
  --content "Use Codex CLI with gpt-5.3-codex-spark for coding tasks — free on Pro plan" \
  --type TEACHING
```

TEACHING nodes connect to related workspace chunks just like CORRECTION nodes,
but without inhibitory edges — they add knowledge instead of suppressing it.

Three injection types:
- **CORRECTION** — creates inhibitory edges that suppress related wrong paths
- **TEACHING** — adds knowledge with normal positive connections
- **DIRECTIVE** — same as TEACHING (use for standing instructions)

For agent frameworks that need to correlate corrections with earlier queries,
see `examples/correction_flow/` for the fired-node logging pattern.

You can also reinforce good retrievals:

```bash
# After a query returns helpful context, strengthen those paths
openclawbrain learn --state brain/state.json --outcome 1.0 \
  --fired-ids "deploy.md::0,deploy.md::1"
```

Or weaken bad ones:

```bash
openclawbrain learn --state brain/state.json --outcome -1.0 \
  --fired-ids "monitoring.md::2"
```

## What it looks like in practice

```bash
# Before learning
openclawbrain query "how do we handle incidents" --state /tmp/brain/state.json --top 3

# After one good learn on the best route
openclawbrain learn --state /tmp/brain/state.json --outcome 1.0 --fired-ids "incidents.md::0,deploy.md::1"

# After one negative learn on a bad route
openclawbrain learn --state /tmp/brain/state.json --outcome -1.0 --fired-ids "monitoring.md::2,incidents.md::0"

# Query again to observe new routing
openclawbrain query "incident runbook for deploy failures" --state /tmp/brain/state.json --top 4
```

## How it compares

| | Plain RAG | OpenClawBrain |
|---|-----------|----------|
| Retrieval | Similarity search | Learned graph traversal |
| Feedback | None | `learn +1/-1` updates edge weights |
| Wrong answers | Can keep resurfacing | Inhibitory edges suppress them |
| Adding knowledge | Re-index/re-embed | `inject --type TEACHING` (no rebuild) |
| Over time | Same results for same query | Routes become habitual behavior |
| Dependencies | Vector DB or service | Zero dependencies |

## How OpenClawBrain differs from related tools

| | OpenClawBrain | Plain RAG | Reflexion | MemGPT |
|---|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| What it learns | Retrieval routes | Nothing | Reasoning via self-reflection text | Memory read/write policies |
| Negative feedback | Inhibitory edges suppress bad paths | None | None (additive only) | None |
| New knowledge | `inject` node (no rebuild) | Re-embed corpus | Add to reflection prompt | Update tier config |
| Integration | Standalone library, any agent | Vector DB required | Tied to agent loop | Tied to agent architecture |
| Cold start | Hash embeddings, no API key | Needs embedding service | Needs prior episodes | Needs configured tiers |
| State | Single `state.json` file | External DB | Prompt history | Multi-tier storage |

## Optional OpenAI embeddings + LLM routing

If you want API-backed embeddings/teacher labeling, use:

- **Embeddings:** `text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim)
- **LLM routing/scoring:** `gpt-5-mini`
- **Offline/testing fallback:** `hash` embeddings (lower quality, no API key required).

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from openclawbrain import split_workspace, VectorIndex

client = OpenAI()


def embed(text):
    return client.embeddings.create(
        model="text-embedding-3-small", input=[text]
    ).data[0].embedding


def llm(system, user):
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": system}, {"role": "user", "content": user}],
    ).choices[0].message.content

graph, texts = split_workspace("./workspace", llm_fn=llm)
index = VectorIndex()
for nid, content in texts.items():
    index.upsert(nid, embed(content))
```

See `examples/openai_embedder/` for a complete example.

## State persistence

State writes are atomic (`temp` + `fsync` + `rename`) with `.bak` backup. Crash-safe.

## Low-Level Worker (`openclawbrain daemon`)

For production use, prefer `openclawbrain serve`, which manages the daemon worker and socket lifecycle.
`openclawbrain daemon` is the low-level NDJSON stdio worker.

Why this matters:

- First load initializes `state.json` once, then keeps the process and index warm.
- Saves process startup/reload overhead versus one-shot CLI calls.
- Reduces memory churn and tail latency under steady traffic.

Start it with:

```bash
openclawbrain daemon --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json
```

Embedding mode defaults to `--embed-model auto`:
- For `local:*` state metadata, daemon queries use local embeddings.
- For `hash-v1` state metadata, daemon queries use hash embeddings.
- For OpenAI-based states, `auto` does not call OpenAI; use `--embed-model openai:<model>` explicitly.
- Use `--embed-model hash` or `--embed-model local` to force offline query embeddings.

Routing mode defaults to `--route-mode learned`. `init` writes a default identity-like `route_model.npz` beside `state.json`; if that file is missing or unloadable, daemon query routing gracefully falls back to `edge+sim`.

Protocol:

- Transport: `stdin`/`stdout` with newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON).
- Each request is a single JSON object with `id`, `method`, and `params`.
- Each response is a single JSON object with the same `id` and either `result` or `error`.

Example request/response:

```bash
echo '{"id":"req-1","method":"query","params":{"query":"how to deploy","top_k":4,"chat_id":"telegram:123"}}' | openclawbrain daemon --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json
```

Enable deterministic query-conditioned habitual routing (no LLM calls on query path):

```bash
echo '{"id":"req-2","method":"query","params":{"query":"how to deploy","top_k":4,"route_mode":"edge+sim","route_top_k":5,"route_alpha_sim":0.5,"route_use_relevance":true}}' | openclawbrain daemon --state ~/.openclawbrain/main/state.json
```

```json
{"id":"req-1","result":{"fired_nodes":["a"],"context":"...","seeds":[["a",0.96]],"embed_query_ms":1.1,"traverse_ms":2.4,"total_ms":3.5}}
```

Supported methods (all 10):

- `query`: run route traversal and return `fired_nodes`, `context`, timing, and seeds.
- `learn`: apply outcomes (`+1/-1`) with default `apply_outcome_pg()` updates and return `edges_updated`.
- `inject`: add TEACHING/CORRECTION/DIRECTIVE nodes and connect them to related workspace chunks.
- `correction`: atomically apply negative feedback to last-fired nodes and inject a CORRECTION node.
- `maintain`: run maintenance ops and return health/merge summary fields.
- `health`: return current health metrics for the loaded graph.
- `info`: return state metadata and object counts.
- `save`: persist current in-memory state to disk immediately.
- `reload`: reload `state.json` without restarting.
- `shutdown`: persist pending writes and exit cleanly.
- `query`/`learn`/`maintain`/`health`/`info` responses include `embed_query_ms`, `traverse_ms`, and `total_ms` timing fields where applicable.
- `query`/`learn`/`inject`/`correction` are the only mutation-capable methods; the daemon is the single source of truth for those changes while state is hot in memory.

Current limitations:

- Per-chat mutation APIs remain scoped through request payloads (`chat_id`) and adapter-layer bookkeeping.
- Concurrent writers are serialized by the socket transport lock and one active request at a time.

See `examples/ops/client_example.py` for a Python client and `docs/architecture.md` for protocol details.

## True Policy Gradient (apply_outcome_pg)

`apply_outcome_pg` implements a full REINFORCE policy-gradient update and is now the default learning rule used by daemon/CLI correction and learn paths.

- It updates **all outgoing edges** for each visited node on the fired trajectory, not only traversed edges.
- It uses the update:
  `Δw = (η(z-b)γ^ℓ)/τ · (𝟙[j=a] - π(j|i))`
  where:
  - `η` = learning rate
  - `z` = outcome reward
  - `b` = baseline
  - `γ` = discount
  - `ℓ` = trajectory depth
  - `τ` = temperature
  - `π(j|i)` = action probability from softmax (including STOP)
  - `𝟙[j=a]` = 1 for the taken action, else 0
- Conservation property: for each source node `i`, outgoing updates sum to zero, so total outgoing mass is preserved.
- Use `apply_outcome_pg` when you want smoother, probability-based updates across alternatives; use `apply_outcome` for a simpler sparse update that only touches traversed edges.

```python
from openclawbrain import apply_outcome_pg, LearningConfig

config = LearningConfig(learning_rate=0.1, temperature=1.0, baseline=0.0)
updates = apply_outcome_pg(graph, fired_nodes=["a", "b", "c"], outcome=1.0, config=config)
```

## Write policy summary

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Durable fact | Edit file → sync re-embeds |
| Correction | Edit file + daemon `correction` method |
| Soft teaching | openclawbrain inject --type TEACHING |
| Wrong retrieval | daemon `correction` (graph-only, no rebuild) |
| New rule | Edit AGENTS.md or SOUL.md |

## Traversal defaults

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `beam_width` | `8` | Frontier size per hop (wider = reaches farther routes) |
| `max_hops` | `30` | Safety ceiling; damping controls convergence |
| `fire_threshold` | `0.01` | Minimum score required to fire a candidate node |
| `reflex_threshold` | `0.6` | Edges with weight `>= 0.6` auto-follow (no route function) |
| `habitual_range` | `0.15 - 0.6` | Edges in this band run through route function |
| `inhibitory_threshold` | `-0.01` | Edges at or below suppress targets |
| `max_fired_nodes` | `None` | Hard stop on fired node count |
| `max_context_chars` | `None` | Hard stop on rendered traversal context |
| `edge_damping` | `0.3` | Per-reuse decay (`weight × 0.3^k`) |

```python
from openclawbrain import traverse, TraversalConfig

result = traverse(
    graph,
    seeds,
    config=TraversalConfig(max_context_chars=20000, max_fired_nodes=30),
)
```

`query` and `query_brain.py` honor these budgets and stop as soon as any termination condition is met.

## External benchmarks

External retrieval benchmarks are optional and use separately downloaded datasets.
OpenClawBrain ships a quick-start workflow for MultiHop-RAG and HotPotQA in
`benchmarks/external/README.md`, but the datasets are not in the repository.

## Evaluation suite (paper-focused)

Use the built-in eval + ablation harness:

```bash
python examples/eval/run_eval.py \
  --state /path/to/state.json \
  --output /tmp/ocb_eval_summary.json
```

Run the synthetic two-cluster routing simulation:

```bash
python examples/eval/simulate_two_cluster_routing.py \
  --output-dir /tmp/ocb_two_cluster
```

Run the industry baseline suite (JSON + CSV + report in scratch):

```bash
python examples/eval/run_baselines.py \
  --state /path/to/state.json \
  --output-dir scratch/industry-baselines/latest
```

Baseline matrix (industry standard):

| Mode | Description | Optional deps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vector_topk` | Vector similarity top-k only | none |
| `vector_topk_rerank` | Vector top-k reranked by BM25 | `openclawbrain[reranker]` |
| `pointer_chase` | Deterministic pointer-chasing simulator | none |
| `learned` | OpenClawBrain learned routing | route model |
| `edge_sim_legacy` | Legacy edge+sim routing | none |

See [docs/evaluation-plan.md](docs/evaluation-plan.md) for baselines, metrics, ablation matrix, and dataset guidance.

## State lifecycle

- **Where it lives:** a single `state.json` file (portable, version-controllable)
- **How big:** depends on workspace size and embedder (`hash` smaller, dense embeddings larger)
- **When to rebuild:** after major workspace restructuring or embedder changes
- **Embedder changes:** OpenClawBrain stores the embedder name + dimension in state metadata and hard-fails on mismatch — no silent corruption
- **Maintenance:** use `openclawbrain maintain` (`decay` + `scale` + `split` + `merge` + `prune` + `connect`) to rebalance structure as the graph evolves

## Core thesis (recommended reading)

- **Shadow routing + Ultimate Policy Gradient:** `docs/core-thesis-ultimate-policy-gradient.md`
- **UPG routing math appendix:** `docs/ultimate-policy-gradient-routing-math.md`

## Cost control

- **Default OOTB:** `openclawbrain init` uses local BGE-small embeddings (`--embedder auto` -> local -> hash fallback) and writes vectors to `state.json`.
- **Optional OpenAI:** install `openclawbrain[openai]` and use `--embedder openai` (or OpenAI teacher labeling via `async-route-pg`) when you want API-backed labels/embeddings.
- **Batch init:** `openclawbrain init` embeds all workspace files in one batch call. Subsequent queries reuse cached vectors.
- **Explicit control:** use `--embedder local` / `--embedder hash` / `--embedder openai` to force a specific embedder. Use `--llm none` to skip LLM-assisted splitting.

## Warm start from sessions

If you have prior conversation logs, replay them. By default, `replay` runs
`--mode edges-only` (cheap/fast, no LLM, no harvest):

```bash
openclawbrain replay --state /tmp/brain/state.json --sessions ./sessions/
```

OpenClaw media uploads are usually logged as user text stubs like
`[media attached: ...]`. Those stubs alone have little semantic value, so they
often do not improve memory quality by themselves. The useful text typically
arrives in later `toolResult` messages (OCR, image captions, audio transcript).

Recommended approach:

- Use dedicated media tools to emit transcript/OCR/caption text as `toolResult`.
- Let OpenClawBrain attach allowlisted `toolResult` text to media-stub user
  queries during replay and expose the same text to fast-learning windows.

Replay controls for this behavior:

```bash
openclawbrain replay \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --sessions ./sessions/ \
  --include-tool-results \
  --tool-result-allowlist image,openai-whisper,openai-whisper-api,openai-whisper-local,summarize \
  --tool-result-max-chars 20000
```

- `--include-tool-results` / `--no-include-tool-results` (default enabled)
- `--tool-result-allowlist` (comma-separated tool names)
- `--tool-result-max-chars` (max allowlisted tool text appended per user query)

To run the full pipeline explicitly, use `--mode full` (or legacy alias
`--full-learning` / `--full-pipeline`).

For cheap edge-only replay (no LLM, no harvest):

```bash
openclawbrain replay \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --sessions ./sessions/ \
  --mode edges-only
```

For transcript-backed fast-learning only (no harvest):

```bash
openclawbrain replay \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --sessions ./sessions/ \
  --mode fast-learning \
  --resume \
  --workers 4 \
  --checkpoint /tmp/brain/replay_checkpoint.json
```
`--extract-learning-events` is an alias for `--fast-learning`.

For cutover-friendly startup (inject quickly, then start daemon immediately):

```bash
openclawbrain replay \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --sessions ./sessions/ \
  --mode fast-learning \
  --stop-after-fast-learning \
  --checkpoint /tmp/brain/replay_checkpoint.json
```
`--workers` controls fast-learning LLM extraction concurrency (this stage is often the slowest, because it is LLM-bound).

For durable long replays with periodic progress/checkpoint/state persistence:

```bash
openclawbrain replay \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --sessions ./sessions/ \
  --mode edges-only \
  --resume \
  --checkpoint /tmp/brain/replay_checkpoint.json \
  --checkpoint-every-seconds 60 \
  --checkpoint-every 1 \
  --persist-state-every-seconds 30 \
  --progress-every 250
```
By default, replay also emits progress heartbeats every 30 seconds; use `--quiet` to suppress banners/progress.

When `--json` is set, progress is emitted as JSONL events:
`{"type":"progress","phase":"replay",...}`.

For simple true-parallel replay v0:

```bash
openclawbrain replay \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --sessions ./sessions/ \
  --mode edges-only \
  --replay-workers 4 \
  --checkpoint-every 1
```
`--replay-workers` controls edge replay workers. Values greater than `1` trade strict sequential replay behavior for a deterministic shard/merge approximation.

Parallel replay v0 is an approximation: workers process deterministic shards and
compute replay deltas without mutating shared state; the reducer applies those
deltas in deterministic merge order, with checkpoints after each merge batch.

To enable decay during an edges-only replay:

```bash
openclawbrain replay \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --sessions ./sessions/ \
  --mode edges-only \
  --decay-during-replay \
  --decay-interval 10
```

`--decay-interval N` controls how many learning steps occur between each decay
pass (default 10).

Missing or rotated session files are skipped with a warning instead of aborting
the run, so long rebuilds survive file rotation.

The fast-learning and harvest pipeline is sidecar-only to the core files:
`learning_events.jsonl` is append-only, and `replay` updates `state.json` via the same graph mutation model as existing injection commands.

## Async teacher routing (offline)

`query` and daemon query stay LLM-free and fast. `async-route-pg` is a separate background loop that samples recent journaled queries, replays local traversal, asks a teacher model which candidate edges it would choose, then applies dense policy-gradient updates with `apply_outcome_pg`.

Dry-run is the default (no writes), machine-readable JSON:

```bash
openclawbrain async-route-pg \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --since-hours 24 \
  --max-queries 200 \
  --sample-rate 0.1 \
  --teacher openai \
  --teacher-model gpt-5-mini \
  --json
```

Apply mode (writes updates):

```bash
openclawbrain async-route-pg \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --since-hours 24 \
  --max-queries 200 \
  --sample-rate 0.1 \
  --teacher openai \
  --teacher-model gpt-5-mini \
  --apply \
  --json
```

Notes:
- Default is dry-run (no state write); add `--apply` to persist updates.
- If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing (or `--teacher none`), it still runs but reports teacher unavailable and applies no updates.
- The updates improve edge weights/metadata that downstream `maintain` (`split/merge/prune/connect`) already consumes.

## Learned route model training

OpenClawBrain now supports `route_mode=learned` at runtime with a trainable low-rank route model (`openclawbrain.route_model`).

OOTB behavior:
- `openclawbrain init` writes `/path/to/brain/route_model.npz` using an identity-like bilinear model.
- Daemon defaults to `route_mode=learned`, so new brains use bilinear runtime routing immediately.
- Retrain anytime with `openclawbrain train-route-model ... --out /path/to/brain/route_model.npz`.

Storage boundary modules:
- `openclawbrain.storage.state_store`: `StateStore` / `JsonStateStore`
- `openclawbrain.storage.event_store`: `EventStore` / `JsonlEventStore`

Unified label schema:
- `openclawbrain.labels.LabelRecord` with `reward_source` + `weight`
- works across teacher labels, human corrections, and self-learning events

Training flow:

```bash
# 1) Build traces (optionally include query vectors)
openclawbrain async-route-pg \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --traces-out /tmp/brain/route_traces.jsonl \
  --include-query-vector \
  --teacher none

# 2) Train route model
openclawbrain train-route-model \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --traces-in /tmp/brain/route_traces.jsonl \
  --out /tmp/brain/route_model.npz \
  --rank 16 \
  --epochs 3 \
  --lr 0.01 \
  --label-temp 0.5 \
  --json

# 3) Run daemon with learned route mode
openclawbrain daemon \
  --state /tmp/brain/state.json \
  --route-mode learned \
  --route-model /tmp/brain/route_model.npz
```

Replay/harvest now optionally emit route traces + labels:
- `openclawbrain replay --traces-out ... --labels-out ...`
- `openclawbrain harvest --traces-out ... --labels-out ...`

## Design Tenets

- No network calls in core.
- No secret discovery (no dotfiles, no keychain lookup).
- Embedder identity stored in state metadata; hard-fail on dimension mismatch.
- One canonical state format (`state.json`).
- Traversal defaults are budget-first for safety: `beam_width=8`, `max_hops=30`, `fire_threshold=0.01`.
