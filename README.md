# 🦀 CrabPath

CrabPath is a memory store for AI agents that learns what to retrieve — and what to suppress — from experience.

## Why?

- Static context loading wastes tokens because you load too much every turn.
- Classic RAG can’t learn from feedback, so retrieval stays similarity-only.
- CrabPath tracks which retrieval paths worked, and builds a graph of learned routes.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.crabpath-env && source ~/.crabpath-env/bin/activate
pip install crabpath            # PyPI
clawhub install crabpath        # or ClawHub (OpenClaw agents)

# For embeddings (strongly recommended):
pip install crabpath[openai]     # or: pip install crabpath[google]
```

Zero required dependencies. Python 3.10+. macOS Homebrew Python needs a venv (PEP 668).

## Quick Start (60 seconds)

```python
from crabpath import Node, Edge, Graph, activate, learn

g = Graph()
g.add_node(Node("timeout", "Deployment timed out"))
g.add_node(Node("rollback", "Rollback and restore"))
g.add_node(Node("debug", "Inspect logs"))
g.add_edge(Edge("timeout", "rollback", 0.6))
g.add_edge(Edge("timeout", "debug", 0.4))

result = activate(g, seeds={"timeout": 1.0})
learn(g, result, outcome=1.0)  # reinforces paths that fired
print([node.id for node, energy in result.fired])
```

## For AI Agents (3 commands)

```bash
crabpath init --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace --sessions ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/
crabpath install-hook --agent-workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace
crabpath query 'how do I deploy' --graph ~/.crabpath/graph.json --index ~/.crabpath/embed.json --top 8 --json
```

## Which Interface?

| Interface | Status / Use |
|---|---|
| CLI (agents) | Primary agent-facing interface; JSON I/O for shell workflows. |
| MemoryController (Python) | Recommended direct integration for Python apps. |
| Adapter | Deprecated legacy bridge; prefer CLI or MemoryController. |

## How It Works

- Documents are split into nodes and edges become weighted pointers.
- Reflex edges (`>0.8`) auto-follow with near-zero overhead.
- Habitual edges (`0.3-0.8`) go through normal routing policy.
- Dormant edges (`<0.3`) are suppressed by default.
- Positive outcomes (`+1`) strengthen paths; negative outcomes (`-1`) create inhibitory edges.
- Decay drops unused connections, while the autotuner keeps graph routing healthy.

## Key Results

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Context reduction | 90-99% |
| Negation accuracy | 1.0 vs 0.0 (BM25) |
| Internal tests | 360 |
| Required deps | Zero |

## When NOT to Use CrabPath

- Simple static-document RAG without feedback loops (use a vector DB).
- Very small codebases (`< 10` files) with insufficient structure to learn recurring routes.
- One-off questions with no recurring retrieval patterns.
